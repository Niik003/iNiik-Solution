                    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                        emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.</p>
                    <p>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It
                        is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
                    </p>
                    <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming
                        language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[33] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                        introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection,
                        reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that
                        is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with
                        version 2.7.18 in 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica
                        (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by
                        SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
                        Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the
                        project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation"
                        from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python
                        community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief
                        decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering
                        Council to lead the project.</p>
                    <p>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0,
                        released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and
                        2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python
                        2 code to Python 3.
                    </p>
                    <p>Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a
                        large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further
                        security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's
                        end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later where supported, and later support for 3.6 also
                        dropped.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and so were older releases including 3.8.13, and
                        3.7.13 because of many security issues in 2022. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were also
                        expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to possible
                        remote code execution and web cache poisoning.</p>
                    <p>Python 3.6 (and every older release), is no longer supported as of 2021.</p>
                    <h2>Design philosophy and features</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured
                        programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and
                        aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects [magic methods] ).
                        Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic
                        programming.</p>
                    <p>Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage
                        collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds
                        method and variable names during program execution.
                    </p>
                    <p>Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has
                        filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator
                        expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement
                        functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.
                    </p>
                    <p>Its core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes
                        aphorisms such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
                        <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
                        <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
                        <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
                        <li>Readability counts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly
                        extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of
                        adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core
                        language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his
                        frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.</p>
                    <p>Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice
                        in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto,
                        Python embraces a "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it"
                        philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book
                        author, wrote: "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python
                        culture."</p>
                    <p>Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical
                        parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at
                        the cost of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical
                        functions to extension modules written in languages such as C; or use PyPy, a just-in-time
                        compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct
                        C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.</p>
                    <p>Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the
                        British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and
                        reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (a reference to a Monty Python
                        sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.</p>
                    <p>A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a wide range of meanings
                        related to program style. "Pythonic" code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency
                        in the language, or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.
                        Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another
                        programming language is called unpythonic.</p>
                    <p>Python users and admirers, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often
                        referred to as Pythonistas.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting
                        them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and
                        receive results immediately.</p>
                    <p>Python also comes with an Integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is more
                        beginner-oriented.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion,
                        session state retention and syntax highlighting.
                    </p>
                    <p>As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based
                        IDEs, including SageMath, for developing science- and math-related programs; PythonAnywhere, a
                        browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE emphasizing
                        scientific computing.
