                    <dl>
                        <dt>Creation at Netscape :</dt>
                        <dd>The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993.
                            Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the
                            nascent World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape
                            corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This
                            quickly became the most-used.</dd>
                        <dd>During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the
                            capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire
                            in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape
                            decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this:
                            collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also
                            hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.</dd>
                        <dd>Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language,
                            with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6]
                            Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when
                            first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to
                            JavaScript for the official release in December.</dd>
                        <dd>The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related
                            to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich
                            considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.</dd>
                        <dt>Adoption by Microsoft :</dt>
                        <dd>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the
                            JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own,
                            called JScript.</dd>
                        <dd>JScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to
                            HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in
                            Navigator. These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites
                            work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best
                            viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.</dd>
                        <dt>The rise of JScript :</dt>
                        <dd>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point
                            for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the
                            official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.</dd>
                        <dd>The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June
                            1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.</dd>
                        <dd>Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the
                            early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%. This meant that JScript became
                            the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.</dd>
                        <dd>Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in
                            its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript
                            4 was mothballed.</dd>
                        <dt>Growth and standardization :</dt>
                        <dd>During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting
                            was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla,
                            released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market
                            share from Internet Explorer.</dd>
                        <dd>In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X)
                            standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe
                            Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an
                            ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To
                            this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project.
                            However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side
                            scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.</dd>
                        <dd>Meanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not
                            affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he
                            coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the
                            backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding
                            the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded
                            by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries
                            were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.</dd>
                        <dd>Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster
                            than its competition. The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other
                            browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.</dd>
                        <dd>In July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to
                            the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language
                            forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.</dd>

                    <hr>
                    <p>JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 97% of websites using
                        it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact
                        with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on
                        the user's device.</p>
                    <dt>Examples of scripted behavior :</dt>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For
                            example, users of social media can send and receive messages without leaving the current
                            page.</li>
                        <li>Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving them.</li>
                        <li>Playing browser games.</li>
                        <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>
                        <li>Generating pop-up ads.</li>
                        <li>Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.</li>
                        <li>Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can
                            use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.</li>
                        <li>Redirecting a user to another page.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <dt>Libraries and frameworks :</dt>
                    <p>Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side
                        scripting.</p>
                    <p>jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites. Facebook created the
                        React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including
                        Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites,
                        including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, the term "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or
                        frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.</p>
